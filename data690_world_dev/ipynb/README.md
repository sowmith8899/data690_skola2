# Individual Project Part B

For this part, you are a data scientist and will use Jupyter Notebook to recreate the charts you used in Part A using Plotly Express.
You can copy and paste the texts from your Part A into your Jupyter Notebook and format them so that your Notebook will be a self-contained well-documented project.

## Special instructions

1. Please format the Jupyter Notebook file neatly and nicely for readability. Treat it as a research paper and a project in your professional portfolio.
2. The file must be self-explanatory and can stand alone so the readers understand the project without having to read other documents or ask you for clarification.
3. Use markdown cell for large block of texts such as background, data sources, list of elements and their meanings. 
4. In a code cell, use comments above a line of code or to the right of a line of code to annotate/comment the code only necessary.
5. Limit the length of outputs. For example, don't output more data than necessary. Use head/tail/sample function on dataframe to limit the number of rows displayed (5 or less is good); 
6. Structure your notebook with headings including sequence numbers and section titles similar to a paper. Also use bold, italic, bulletted list, etc.
7. Don't do complicated techniques or too many techniques, keep it simple and focus on the clarity of concepts and the style of communications. 
8. You are graded both on the substance and the style.
