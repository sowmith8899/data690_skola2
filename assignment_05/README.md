1) Watch the video (over 4 hours) and learn.
The video has 8 parts, you should create 8 separate Jupyter Notebooks, one for each part.
You must check in all 8 Jupyter Notebooks.
As you watch, you create Jupyter Notebooks in Colab and follow along. Pause, run your code, and continue as necessary.
On YouTube website, below the video, there are clear instructions and also links to Jupyter Notebooks in GitHub.
You should download the datasets and upload to Google Colab so your Jupyter Notebook has access to the data.
You can open the trainer's Jupyter Notebook and copy/paste his code if necessary to avoid typing.
This exercise is to make up for the class and also serve as the homework 05. 
2) You also need to write a text document using Markdown (.md file).
In the file, you list and summarize the things (package/module, function/method, tricks, etc.) you have learned from the video. 
Be as specific and detailed as possible. The file needs to be well formated and styled. It is kind of class notes and can be useful for future or sharing with others.
